### Plugin Summary

The **LocalDiff** Plugin for Minecraft 1.21 is designed to allow players to check the local difficulty of their current chunk by executing the command `/localdifficulty`. This plugin calculates the local difficulty based on several factors:

1. **Inhabited Time**: The time the chunk has been inhabited by players.
2. **World Time**: The total time the world has been running.
3. **World Difficulty**: The game's difficulty setting (Easy, Normal, Hard).

When a player runs the `/localdifficulty` command, the plugin retrieves the local difficulty for the chunk the player is in and displays it to the player in the chat. This helps players understand the difficulty level of the region they are currently in, which can affect mob spawning rates and the overall challenge of the game.
